**BotPlattform** is a FastAPI-based web application that allows you to create, manage, and provide various bots to users. The platform offers a RESTful API through which users and administrators can interact with the bots. The application supports user registration, authentication, and role-based access control.

## Module and Files Overview

- **`api/`**: Contains the routes for API endpoints that can be accessed by users and administrators. This includes routes for authentication, bot management, and user management.

- **`core/`**: Contains central configuration and security functions. This includes configurations for the application, security functions such as password hashing, and JWT token creation.

- **`crud/`**: Defines the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for users and bots, which interact directly with the database.

- **`models/`**: Contains the SQLAlchemy models representing the database tables. These models define the structure of the database.

- **`main.py`**: The main application file and entry point for the FastAPI app. This is where the API routers are registered and the application is started.

- **`schemas.py`**: Defines the Pydantic schemas for data validation and serialization. These schemas are used to define the structure and types of incoming and outgoing data.

- **`pyproject.toml`**: The project configuration file for Poetry, containing all dependencies and metadata for the project.

- **`test.db`**: A SQLite database file used during development. This can be replaced with another database in a production environment.
